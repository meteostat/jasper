# Meteostat Routines

This repository is a collection of automated routines for importing, exporting and managing weather and climate data with Python. Its purpose is the maintenance of the Meteostat database which provides detailed historical time series for thousands of weather stations worldwide.

The data is imported from different governmental interfaces which provide open weather and climate data.

## Contributing

Meteostat is a voluntary initiative that fosters open source. We rely on coding enthusiasts who are passionate about meteorology to grow our database and collect as much weather and climate data as possible.

## Project Management

The backlog and all active tasks are publicly available on our [Kanban board](https://planning.meteostat.org/?controller=BoardViewController&action=show&plugin=&project_id=6&search=category%3A6).
