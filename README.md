# Meteostat Routines
This repository is a collection of automated routines for importing and managing weather and climate data with Python. Its purpose is the maintenance of the Meteostat database which provides detailed historical time series for thousands of weather station worldwide.
The data is imported from different governmental interfaces which provide open weather and climate data.
## Contributing
Meteostat is a voluntary initiative that fosters open source. We rely on coding enthusiasts who are passionate about meteorology to grow our database and collect as much weather and climate data as possible.
## Legacy Code
Meteostat started as a beginner's coding project, written in PHP, and developed into a large platform for weather statistics. As thousands of users are starting to use the project's web application and API, Meteostat needs to shift its amateur code base to a more professional setup. We decided to go with Python due its popularity and the great ability to work with large amounts of data.
## Testing
For now we will only do manual testing. However, a proper strategy for code testing will be defined in the near future.
